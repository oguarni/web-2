# Optimization Suggestions

This document provides suggestions for improving the performance and code quality of the application.

## Docker Optimization

*   **Multi-stage Builds:** Use multi-stage builds to reduce the size of the final Docker image.
*   **`.dockerignore`:** Ensure that the `.dockerignore` file is properly configured to exclude unnecessary files from the build context.

## Query Performance Improvements

*   **Eager Loading:** Use eager loading (`include`) to fetch associated data in a single query and avoid the N+1 problem.
*   **Database Indexes:** Add indexes to frequently queried columns to improve query performance.
*   **Pagination:** Implement pagination for all endpoints that return a list of resources.

## Caching Strategies

*   **Redis:** Use Redis to cache frequently accessed data, such as user sessions and API responses.

## Monitoring Setup

*   **Prometheus & Grafana:** Use Prometheus and Grafana to monitor the performance of the application and the health of the services.

## Code Quality

*   **Service Layer:** Extract the business logic from the controllers into a separate service layer.
*   **Repository Pattern:** Implement the repository pattern to centralize the data access logic.
*   **Dependency Injection:** Use a dependency injection container to improve the modularity of the application.
