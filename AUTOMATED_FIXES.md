# Automated Fixes

This document lists all the changes that were made automatically to the codebase.

## Phase 1: Environment & Dependency Audit

*   **File:** `package.json`
    *   **Change:** Upgraded `express` from `^4.18.2` to `^4.19.2` to patch security vulnerabilities.
    *   **Justification:** The previous version of `express` had known security vulnerabilities (CVE-2024-29041, CVE-2024-43796).

*   **File:** `.env.example`
    *   **Change:** Added a comment with a command to generate a strong JWT secret.
    *   **Justification:** The previous `JWT_SECRET` was a weak placeholder.
    *   **Change:** Changed `POSTGRES_HOST` to `postgres` to align with Docker networking.
    *   **Justification:** The `docker-compose.yml` file expects the database host to be `postgres`.

*   **File:** `docker-compose.yml`
    *   **Change:** Updated the PostgreSQL service to use environment variables from the `.env` file.
    *   **Justification:** This ensures consistency between the Docker environment and the local development environment.

## Phase 2: Database Integrity Testing

*   **File:** `models/relational/usuario.js`
    *   **Change:** Added an index to the `type` field.
    *   **Justification:** This will improve the performance of queries that filter users by role.

*   **File:** `models/relational/espaco.js`
    *   **Change:** Added an index to the `active` field.
    *   **Justification:** This will improve the performance of queries that filter spaces by their active status.

## Phase 4: Business Logic Validation

*   **File:** `controllers/api/spaceAmenityController.js`
    *   **Change:** Refactored the controller to use `asyncHandler` for consistent error handling.
    *   **Justification:** This aligns the controller with the error handling strategy used in the rest of the application.
    *   **Change:** Standardized the logging format to be consistent with the rest of the application.
    *   **Justification:** This improves the readability and consistency of the logs.

## Phase 5: Security Audit

*   **File:** `middlewares/validation.js`
    *   **Change:** Updated the `userType` validation to include `3` as a valid user type.
    *   **Justification:** The previous validation schema was missing the `Manager` role.
