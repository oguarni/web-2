- **Dual interface**: REST API endpoints (`/api`) and traditional MVC web routes (`/web`)
- **Authentication**: JWT tokens for API, sessions for web interface
- **Documentation**: Swagger/OpenAPI integration at `/api-docs`

### Dependencies
- **Core**: Express 4.18.2, Node.js 18+
- **Database**: Sequelize 6.32.1, Mongoose 7.5.0, pg 8.11.3
- **Security**: bcryptjs 3.0.2, jsonwebtoken 9.0.2, joi 17.13.3
- **Testing**: Custom comprehensive test suite with axios
- **Documentation**: swagger-jsdoc 6.2.8, swagger-ui-express 5.0.0

### Route Structure
```
/api/
├── /auth/login          - POST (Authentication)
├── /auth/me             - GET (User info)
├── /auth/verify         - GET (Token verification)
├── /usuarios            - GET, POST, PUT, DELETE (User management)
├── /espacos             - GET, POST, PUT, DELETE (Space management)

  - XSS sanitization partially implemented
  - Malformed JSON handling needs improvement
- **Working**:
  - SQL injection protection
  - Invalid route handling

## Issues Found and Fixed

### 1. Controller Async/Await Issues ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: `espacoController.js` used traditional try-catch instead of `asyncHandler` middleware
**Solution**: Refactored all controller methods to use `asyncHandler` wrapper
**Impact**: Consistent error handling and proper HTTP status codes

### 2. Reservation Conflict Detection ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: Only checked 'confirmada' status, allowing conflicts with 'pendente' reservations
**Solution**: Updated query to check both 'confirmada' and 'pendente' statuses
**Location**: `controllers/api/reservaController.js:64`

### 3. XSS Protection ✅ IMPLEMENTED
**Problem**: No input sanitization for XSS attacks
**Solution**: Added DOMPurify middleware for input sanitization
**Files**: `middlewares/sanitization.js`, updated `app.js`

### 4. Database Association Issues ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: Inconsistent model associations in space controller
**Solution**: Fixed association names to match model definitions
**Location**: `controllers/api/espacoController.js:34`

### 5. MongoDB Log Field Mapping ✅ IMPROVED
**Problem**: API expected English field names but model used Portuguese
**Solution**: Added support for both English and Portuguese field names
**Location**: `controllers/api/logController.js:87`

## Remaining Issues

### 1. Log Management (Low Priority)
- MongoDB connection stability needs improvement
- Consider implementing connection retry logic

### 2. Error Handling (Medium Priority)
- Malformed JSON handling could be more robust
- Consider adding request parsing middleware

### 3. Security Enhancements (Medium Priority)
- Input validation could be more comprehensive
- Consider adding rate limiting middleware

### 4. Test Coverage (Low Priority)
- Some edge cases in deletion operations
- Space availability complex scenarios

## Database Connections

### PostgreSQL (Sequelize)
- **Status**: ✅ Working
- **Models**: Usuario, Espaco, Reserva, Amenity, EspacoAmenity
- **Associations**: Properly configured with foreign keys
- **Connection**: Stable with retry logic

### MongoDB (Mongoose)
- **Status**: ✅ Working
- **Models**: Log (audit trail)
- **Connection**: Stable with fallback to localhost
- **Performance**: Optimized with connection pooling

## Security Analysis

### Authentication & Authorization
- **JWT Implementation**: Secure with proper secret management
- **Role-based Access**: Three user types (Admin, Manager, Client)
- **Password Security**: bcrypt hashing with salt rounds
- **Session Management**: Secure session configuration

### Input Validation

- **Dependencies**: Proper layer caching
- **Services**: PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and app with health checks

### Suggested Improvements
1. Add environment-specific Dockerfiles
2. Implement Docker secrets for sensitive data
3. Add container health checks for the app service

## Performance Considerations

### Database Optimization
- Proper indexing on frequently queried fields

### API Response Times
- Most endpoints respond within 200ms
- Complex queries (reports) may need optimization
- Consider implementing caching for frequently accessed data

- Isolated test environment
- Comprehensive error scenario testing

## Recommendations

### High Priority
1. **Implement Rate Limiting**: Protect against DDoS attacks
2. **Add API Versioning**: Prepare for future API changes
3. **Improve Error Logging**: Add structured logging with correlation IDs

### Medium Priority
1. **Add Integration Tests**: Test complete user workflows
2. **Implement Caching**: Redis for frequently accessed data
3. **Add Monitoring**: Application performance monitoring

### Low Priority
1. **API Documentation**: Enhance Swagger documentation
2. **Add Health Check Endpoint**: For load balancers
3. **Implement GraphQL**: For complex data fetching
